**Semantic ORB-SLAM3: An Enhanced ORB-SLAM3 System with Real-time Object Detection and Dynamic Object Handling - 2023**<br/>
Minoru Dhananjaya J. A., Jonathan M. Aitken<br/>
This project presents Semantic ORB-SLAM3, a system that integrates object detection and dynamic handling capabilities 
into the ORB-SLAM3. In Semantic ORB-SLAM3, YOLOv5 algorithm is employed to recognize objects and distinguish between static 
and dynamic objects. The dynamic handling process filters the features associated with classified dynamic objects 
and extracts additional ORB features to complement the filtering.
