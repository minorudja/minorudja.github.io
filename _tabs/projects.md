**Semantic ORB-SLAM3: An Enhanced ORB-SLAM3 System with Real-time Object Detection and Dynamic Object Handling - 2023**

The project presents Semantic ORB-SLAM3, a system that integrates object detection and dynamic handling capabilities 
into the ORB-SLAM3. YOLOv5 algorithm is employed to recognize objects and distinguish between static and dynamic objects. 
The dynamic handling process filters the features associated with dynamic objects and extracts additional ORB features to 
complement the filtering.
